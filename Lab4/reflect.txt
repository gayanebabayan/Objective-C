In general it is an interesting and effective workshop, 
where the hardest part for me was to get the idea of visualizing the whole picture.

While doing workshop-4 I've learnt how to use the idea of composition objects in a real example.
In this particular case, I was able to design and code objects' composition, where the idea is that it
has a very strong relationship between classes and implements a complete control/ownership.
To be more specific, in our workshop-4, Notifications is responsible both for creating and for destroying Messages.
Also in workshop-4, I have had chance to practice the technic of parcing the string, separating and storing parts of it.
